# CHURN NOT CHURN?

# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to predict customer churn based on various features related to customer characteristics and subscription details. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to:

- Identify key factors influencing customer retention.
- Apply machine learning techniques to build a predictive model.
- Enable businesses to proactively take actions to retain valuable customers and improve customer satisfaction.

## Dataset

The dataset includes customer details such as:

- **Demographics**: Age, gender, location, etc.
- **Subscription Details**: Plan type, duration, renewal status, etc.
- **Usage Metrics**: Frequency of usage, engagement level, etc.
- **Support Interaction**: Number of customer service interactions, complaints, etc.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   - Identifying trends and correlations
   - Visualizing customer behavior

3. **Model Development**

   - Training various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
   - Evaluating performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

4. **Model Optimization**
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Feature selection
   - Addressing class imbalance

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion

This project provides a data-driven approach to understanding customer churn. By leveraging machine learning, businesses can proactively reduce churn rates and enhance customer satisfaction.
